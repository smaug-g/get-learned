# get-learned

## This is the code repo for our ELEC 301 final project: movie genre classification.
### Members:
* Benjamin Gruber
* Sergio Mauricio Guerrero Gaona
* Manuel Pacheco
* Louis Smidt

We each built a classifier based on different features. 

Louis and Manuel worked on data augmentation, and a Convolutional NN on posters (dir lou/), 

Mauricio worked on vectorizing title and building an SVM on title + runtime + score (dir mau/)

Benjamin worked with random forest decision trees on color histograms of the posters and stacked together all of the models we built (dir bg/).
